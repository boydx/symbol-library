# npmap-symbol-library
National Park Service map symbols optimized for the web, version 1.0.

## File Structure
Source .svg artwork can be found in the svg-set-comprehensive folder. In addition, .pngs have been created from the .svgs and are housed in their own folder.

The npmaki folder contains all source artwork and supporting files for creating the symbols used in Builder. These tools were forked from Mapbox Maki; more information can be found in that folder's readme.

## Adding new symbols
Add suggestions for new symbols as an issue on our issue tracker. Newly developed symbols will be bundled into periodic releases. Currently, each symbol is designed for optimal display at the sizes of 16, 24, and 32px; and adapted to 9, 13, and 17px in NPMaki for use in Builder.
